GAME_RESOLUTION = 1080

The resolution you're running genshin at (number corresponds to the
resolution height in pixels).

NOTE: If you're using DLDSR/DLSS/NVIDIA Image Sharpening or any other
GPU configuration that performs image upscaling or oversampling
(not counting the built-in AMD FSR2 anti-aliasing mode),
you'll need to set this to the final output resolution that your
screen will display. E.g. 75% resolution with NVIDIA Image Sharpening
will still result in an image with the same resolution as your monitor,
so you should use the monitor resolution instead of the in-game resolution.

This quick setting only works if you're running the game in fullscreen at a 16:9
aspect ratio. Otherwise, you'll need to set this number to 0 and
manually set the screen coordinates below.

Some common resolutions (any other number is supported):

720: 1280x720 (720p)
1080: 1920x1080 (1080p)
1440: 2560x1440 (1440p)
